            Vaporwave is a microgenre of electronic music, a visual art style, and an Internet meme that emerged in the early 2010s.<sup>[26]</sup> It is defined partly by its slowed-down, chopped and screwed samples of smooth jazz, elevator, R&B, and lounge music from the 1980s and 1990s. The surrounding subculture is sometimes associated with an ambiguous or satirical take on consumer capitalism and pop culture, and tends to be characterized by a nostalgic or surrealist engagement with the popular entertainment, technology and advertising of previous decades. Visually, it incorporates early Internet imagery, late 1990s web design, glitch art, anime, 3D-rendered objects, and cyberpunk tropes in its cover artwork and music videos.<br><br>

            Vaporwave originated as an ironic variant of chillwave, evolving from hypnagogic pop as well as similar retro-revivalist and post-Internet motifs that had become fashionable in underground digital music and art scenes of the era, such as Tumblr's seapunk. The style was pioneered by producers such as James Ferraro, Daniel Lopatin, and Ramona Xavier, who each used various pseudonyms.<sup>[27][28]</sup> After Xavier's album Floral Shoppe (2011) established a blueprint for the genre, the movement built an audience on sites Last.fm, Reddit and 4chan while a flood of new acts, also operating under online pseudonyms, turned to Bandcamp for distribution.<br><br>

            Following the wider exposure of vaporwave in 2012, a wealth of subgenres and offshoots emerged, such as future funk, mallsoft, and hardvapour.<sup>[29]</sup> The genre also intersected with fashion trends such as streetwear and various political movements. Since the mid-2010s, vaporwave has been frequently described as a "dead" genre.<sup>[30]</sup> The general public came to view vaporwave as a facetious Internet meme,<sup>[31]</sup> a notion that frustrated some producers who wished to be recognized as serious artists.

            Vaporwave is a hyper-specific subgenre (or "microgenre")<sup>[32]</sup> that is both a form of electronic music and an art style, although it is sometimes suggested to be primarily a visual medium.<sup>[33]</sup> The genre is defined largely by its surrounding subculture,<sup>[34]</sup> with its music inextricable from its visual accountrements.<sup>[33]</sup> Academic Laura Glitsos writes, "In this way, vaporwave defies traditional music conventions that typically privilege the music over the visual form."<sup>[33]</sup> <br><br>

            Drawing primarily on musical and cultural sources from the 1980s and early 1990s, vaporwave builds upon the experimental and ironic tendencies of chillwave and hypnagogic pop, while also being associated with an ambiguous or satirical take on consumer capitalism and technoculture.<sup>[35][3]</sup> The name derives from "vaporware", a term for commercial software that is announced but never released.<sup>[34]</sup><br><br>

            Creating a vaporwave track requires only the knowledge of rudimentary production techniques.<sup>[36]</sup> It is composed almost entirely from slowed-down samples<sup>[3]</sup> and subverts dance music from the 1980s and 1990s[6] through the use of chopped and screwed techniques, repetition, and heavy reverb.<sup>[33]</sup> Critic Adam Trainer writes of the style's predilection for "music made less for enjoyment than for the regulation of mood", such as corporate stock music for infomercials and product demonstrations.<sup>[37]</sup> Academic Adam Harper described the typical vaporwave track as "a wholly synthesised or heavily processed chunk of corporate mood music, bright and earnest or slow and sultry, often beautiful, either looped out of sync and beyond the point of functionality."<sup>[3]</sup><br><br>

            Adding to its dual engagement with musical and visual art forms, vaporwave embraces the Internet as a cultural, social, and aesthetic medium.<sup>[34]</sup> The visual aesthetic (often stylized as "ＡＥＳＴＨＥＴＩＣＳ", with fullwidth characters)<sup>[18]</sup> incorporates early Internet imagery, late 1990s web design, glitch art, and cyberpunk tropes,<sup>[11]</sup> as well as anime, Greco-Roman statues, and 3D-rendered objects.<sup>[38]</sup> VHS degradation is another common effect seen in vaporwave art. Generally, artists limit the chronology of their source material between Japan's economic flourishing in the 1980s and the September 11 attacks or dot-com bubble burst of 2001 (some albums, including Floral Shoppe, depict the intact Twin Towers on their covers).<sup>[39]</sup><br><br>
